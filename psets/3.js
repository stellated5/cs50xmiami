Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here:
http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm

- Store a radius into a variable.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

// write your solution here...
var radius = 10;
var circumference = Math.PI * 2 * radius;

console.log('The circumference is ' + circumference);

var area = Math.PI * (radius * radius);

console.log('The area is ' + area);
